# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

This is a course project for [ConsenSys Blockchain Developer Bootcamp 2021](https://courses.consensys.net/courses/take/blockchain-developer-bootcamp-registration-2021).

## Basic Idea

This project is to create an application that can help consultants, contractors, and other professionals track time and charge for their work using blockchain technology.

## Time Tracking Contract Workflow

1. Users will have to register themselves on the contract with their address and name.
2. They have to create a project with a name, description, and a budget.
3. They will have to send this project to their client and the client will have to approve it.
4. The contract will lock the deposit from the client.
5. They can then start working and tracking time for the project.
6. Once they are done, they will have to send the deliverables to the client.
7. The client will have to review the deliverables.
8. Once the client approves the deliverables, the contract will unlock the deposit.
